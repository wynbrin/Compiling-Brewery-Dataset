In our research project, our goal is to collect brewery name, ratings and reviews from Yelp API. To get parameters we need, we need to take few steps on API calls in order to pull every parameter we need.\n","\n","**Step 1:** Get Yelp Unique Business ID through Business Search\n","    Yelp has unique business ID for every single business in its database. We need their business id to get their business name from business detail. To start, we need to do business search by terms, which is brewery.\n","    \n","    Limitation:\n","    For parameters in business search, the maximum number of business return per time of API call is 50. We can search 1,000 business for a term in total. That will require 'offset' parameter to get the rest. Ex. In the first code section down below, the limit and offset parameters are set to 50. That means for the first call of business search. The call will return 50 records from 0-50. And for the next call it will return another 50 records from 51 - 100. So, in order to get 1,000 records we may need to call up to 20 times.\n","    For location, abbreviation of United States may allow us to have search the business nationwide. However, the extra would NOT show up if the number of businesses are over 1,000.\n","    \n","**Step 2:** Get business name from Business Details using Business ID\n","    We have our business id ready in step 1. Now, we need to get business name in order to proceed to step 3 for the reviews through Business Details API call.\n","    We take a list of business ids into the endpoint url then output with a list of business names that match to their business id.\n","    \n","**Step 3:** Get reviews from Reviews using Business name\n","    Now we have a list of business names that can be taken into Review API call to get reviews from Yelp.\n","    \n","    Limitation:\n","    Yelp only returns up to three review excerpts for a given business ordered by Yelp's default sort order.\n","    What is Yelp's default sort order?\n","    Yelp's default sort order shows reviews that help consumers make informed decisions. The order is determined by recency, user voting, and other review quality factors, which is why an older review may appear before a newer one. To personalize the experience for each individual user, we'll favor reviews from your friends and the users you follow. You do have the option to sort the reviews in a few other ways: by date, star rating, and those written by Elites.\n","\n","**Step 4:** Merge data outcome into dataframe\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"_66LX0cl-9Es"},"source":["Limitations of Yelp API:\n","  - The link below explains the daily limitations of the yelp API for a given client. A client being the developer or product requesting information from the API. Each client recieves one API key that allows at most 5,000 calls to be made with the key to any of Yelp's API's. The number of calls allowed daily, the number of calls remaining for the given day, and the amount of time remaining before a reset are all maintained through Yelp and visible to developer. Each key's daily limit is reset at midnight or 00:00 UTC, which is 19:00 ET. In our scenario, our data was in total 8,000 breweries and therefore had to split up the data into four buckets. With each bucket containing a list of 2,000 breweries we were able to collect the data all in one day by each creating a key. We first used the key to get the business ID, and then using the ID made another call to get the reviews.\n","\n","- https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/rate_limiting"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"gVK5NHCb_fKs","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":197},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1606785459629,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":388,"user":{"displayName":"Russell Destremps","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgTUIh1Iwc2EHjwTk60nT0C_VxTMI3Le9-5t1TzPQ=s64","userId":"03001984567374689727"}},"outputId":"18987a78-f329-474c-8e1f-3a20087b1588"},"source":["#################################\n","# We had to keep in mind, that whatever size we split the master_list into, we \n","# would be calling that amount twice.
